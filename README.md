## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a robust, machine-learning-powered diagnostic system to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient medical records. In the medical field, misdiagnosing a sick patient as healthy (False Negative) can be fatal. Therefore, this project emphasizes not just overall **Accuracy**, but heavily prioritizes **Recall (Sensitivity)** to ensure maximum patient safety.

## 🚀 Key Features & Workflow
1. **Professional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Comprehensive statistical analysis and correlation mapping to identify the most critical health indicators affecting the heart.
2. **Robust Data Preprocessing:** Applied feature scaling (`StandardScaler`) to normalize data distributions, ensuring distance-based algorithms like KNN perform optimally.
3. **Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilized `GridSearchCV` and Cross-Validation to systematically search for the best model parameters rather than relying on default settings.
4. **Algorithm Comparison:** Evaluated and compared multiple models, specifically **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** vs. **Random Forest Classifier**, to determine the most effective algorithmic approach for this specific medical dataset.
5. **Medical Impact Evaluation:** Leveraged Confusion Matrices and Classification Reports to deeply analyze the clinical reliability of the model.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, KNN, GridSearchCV, StandardScaler)

## 📊 Results & Model Performance
* Successfully trained and optimized multiple predictive models.
* Achieved high classification performance, carefully balancing Accuracy and Recall.
* Extracted actionable medical insights through Feature Importance and correlation analysis, helping identify primary risk factors for heart disease.
